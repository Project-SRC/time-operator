The Time Operator is responsible to operate the time mathematically for the Project SRC stack.

## Usage

Time Operator function is built using OpenFaaS framework, it expects a POST JSON request in the following format:

```json
{
    "operation": String,
    "binary": Bool,
    "times": List[String],
    "base": Int/Float
}
```

- **operation (String)**:

In this field is expected a string with the operation you want to do with the times.
Allowed operations are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

- **binary (Boolean)**:

In this field is expected a boolean (`true` /` false`), to tell the function that the operation will occur between two times.

- **times (List[String])**:

In this field is expected a list of strings, which are the times that will be calculated.
A valid time string is:

```shell
HHH:MM:SS.mmm
```

  - `HHH`: Hours -> this value is optional and can go from 0 to infinty.
  - `MM`: Minutes -> this value is optinal and can go from 0 to 59.
  - `SS`: Seconds -> this value is mandatory and can go from 0 to 59.
  - `mmm`: Miliseconds -> this value is mandatory and can go from 0 to 999.

In case you don't want to send Hours or Minutes remove the colon for those values in the time string:

```shell
:MM:SS.mmm - âœ— WRONG
MM:SS.mmm - âœ” RIGHT
```

- **base (Int/Float)**:

In this field is expected an Int or a Float number, which is used if you're operating a non-binary calculation.
The base number will be calculate to every time on the list.

Example:

```json
{
    "operation": "+",
    "binary": false,
    "times": [
        "1:10.540",
        "12:24.578",
        "23:10:10.789",
        "59.780",
        "01.487",
        "187:07:12.780"
    ],
    "base": 15
}
```

Response example:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "times": [
      "0:01:25.540",
      "0:12:39.578",
      "23:10:25.789",
      "0:01:14.780",
      "0:00:16.487",
      "187:07:27.780"
    ]
  },
  "message": "ðŸ˜€ Successful execution!"
}
```

### Observations

You can obtain the division between two race times to verify how many times a race time is greater or lesser than the other.
For that use a binary operation and the `/` operator.
The result will be sent back in time format. To get the float result just parse the time to a python `timedelta` object and get the seconds:

```python
timedelta(parsed_times).total_seconds()
```

Operations with negative results will be setted to 0.

Only `+` and `-` operators are allowed on a non-binary operation without a base, and the result will be accumulated to only one time.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7.6

## Configuration

The Time Operator configuration is through operating system environment variables. Therefore the configuration must be done in host or must be passed to the container environment.

The available settings are:

> To be defined

If you have questions about how to set environment variables check these links:

- [Environment Variables - Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps)
- [Environment Variables - Docker](https://serverascode.com/2014/05/29/environment-variables-with-docker.html)

**Observation**: The system was developed to run in Linux and Docker environments. No official support for Windows.

## Development

### Installing VirtualEnvWrapper

We recommend using a virtual environment created by the __virtualenvwrapper__ module. There is a virtual site with English instructions for installation that can be accessed [here](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). But you can also follow these steps below for installing the environment:

```shell
sudo python3 -m pip install -U pip             # Update pip
sudo python3 -m pip install virtualenvwrapper  # Install virtualenvwrapper module
```

**Observation**: If you do not have administrator access on the machine remove `sudo` from the beginning of the command and add the flag `--user` to the end of the command.

Now configure your shell to use **virtualenvwrapper** by adding these two lines to your shell initialization file (e.g. `.bashrc`,` .profile`, etc.)

```shell
export WORKON_HOME=\$HOME/.virtualenvs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

If you want to add a specific project location (will automatically go to the project folder when the virtual environment is activated) just add a third line with the following `export`:

```shell
export PROJECT_HOME=/path/to/project
```

Run the shell startup file for the changes to take effect, for example:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now create a virtual environment with the following command (entering the name you want for the environment), in this example I will use the name **time-op**:

```shell
mkvirtualenv -p $(which python3) time-op
```

To use it:

```shell
workon time-op
pip install -r time_operator/requirements.txt
```

For development dependencies (as lint package and tests frameworks) run:

```shell
pip install -r time_operator/dev_requirements.txt
```

**Observaion**: Again, if necessary, add the flag `--user` to make the pipenv package installation for the local user.

### Local Execution

For local system execution, run the following command in the project root folder (assuming _virtualenv_ is already active):

```shell
faas-cli deploy time_operator
```

This will run the system on _localhost_ and will be available on the Open FaaS UI configured for the system. This way you can test new implementations.

## Tests

To run the Time Operator tests follow the script below:

1.  Enable _virtualenv_ **time-op**;
2.  Ensure that the dependencies are installed, especially:

        pytest
        pytest-coverage
        flake8

3.  Run the commands below:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)                                      # Set the python path as the project folder
pytest time_operator/                                         # Performs the tests
pytest --cov=time_operator time_operator/                     # Performs tests evaluating coverage
pytest --cov=time_operator --cov-report xml time_operator/    # Generate the XML report of coverage
flake8 time_operator/                                         # Run PEP8 linter
unset PYTHONPATH                                              # Unset PYTHONPATH variable
```

During the tests the terminal will display a output with the test report (failures, skips and successes) and the system test coverage. For other configurations and supplemental documentation go to [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/latest/) and [coverage](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

During the lint process the terminal will report a bug report and warnings from the PEP8 style guide, for more configurations and additional documentation go to [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart) and [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Build

To build the Time Operator function just follow the script below:

```shell
faas-cli build -f time_operator.yml --build-arg ADDITIONAL_PACKAGE="python3-dev libstdc++ g++"
```

Make sure you have logged in to the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) service. If you do not, run the `docker login` command.

```shell
faas-cli push -f time_operator.yml
```

**Observaion**: Make sure to change the `time_operator.yml` file, so the image name uses your docker hub account username instead of `sconetto`.
